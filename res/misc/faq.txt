-------------------
Where can I find a download link for Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition?

The Minecraft 3DS Community does not condone any piracy unless it is literally impossible to officially purchase. If you want to play this version on a New 3DS/2DS, you need to purchase the cartridge. Otherwise, if you want to play this version on Citra or any other emulator, dump the game files yourself.
-------------------
I have a non-USA system. What title ID do I use?

The USA title ID is 00040000001B8700, the EU title ID is 000400000017CA00, and the JP title ID is 000400000017FD00. 
-------------------
How can I play online multiplayer?

Unfortunately, this version of Minecraft only has two-player local multiplayer player, which means online multiplayer is not possible. If you want to play with your friends on your New 3DS/2DS, you'll have to be in close proximity to them. If you're playing on Citra, however, you can use netplay to play online with your friends. However, this method of multiplayer is very unstable. It's also worth noting that a mod that adds online multiplayer would not work well (or at all, for that matter) due to the limitations of the New 3DS/2DS family of systems.
-------------------
How does the 3DSMP work?

The Minecraft 3DSMP is not online multiplayer. The way it works is that someone plays, puts their inventory in a chest, and then uploads the world to the private Discord channel exclusively for members. Applications are currently closed, but you can join the Discord for updates.
-------------------
How can I submit my own piece of Custom Content?

Each Custom Content category's page has a button for submissions, aside from the Mods section. Pressing the submit button will send you to a page where you can fill out a Google Form with information about your custom content. This button and Google Form is currently absent from the Mod section's page due to the wide variety of mods that are possible and for quality control. Join the Discord server to ask a Staff member to add your Mod to the website.
